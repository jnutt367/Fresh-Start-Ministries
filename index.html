                begins with intervention by confronting individuals with their dysfunctions and their impact on their life. From their, using principles of accountability and spirituality, the men are introduced to positive role models who help to redirect
                their life physically, mentally, and spiritually. Fresh Start provides an atmosphere of discipline, using Christ-centered principles, support and a sensible knowledge of addiction recovery.</p>

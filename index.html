            <p style="margin-top: 50px;">Fresh Start Ministries began helping men in the Central Florida area in June of 1986. Fresh Start enables men to recover from their addiction through a safe and secure environment, classes, support groups, and biblical counseling. The program
                begins with intervention by confronting individuals with their dysfunctions and their impact on their life. From their, using principles of accountability and spirituality, the men are introduced to positive role models who help to redirect
                their life physically, mentally, and spiritually. Fresh Start provides an atmosphere of discipline, using Christ-centered principles, support and a sensible knowledge of addiction recovery.</p>
            <p>By providing a strong biblical foundation and support in a family-like environment, the men are taught communication and relational skills, strong individual and family values, and the foundation of the Christian life, thereby strengthening
                their moral and social values. As a faith-based nonprofit organization, Fresh Start Ministries’ guiding philosophy is “Recovery and Restoration through Jesus”.</p>
